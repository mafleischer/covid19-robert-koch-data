Some evaluation on the official covid19 data for Germany of the Robert Koch institute

Just getting into Data Science with Python I thought might get some useful insight
on official covid19 data for Germany (where I'm based). The data sets are publicized
by the Robert Koch institute. As one of the very few official sources you might
want to look into these rather than media reports.
