# Working with covid19 data for Germany (Robert Koch Institute)
Some evaluation of the official covid19 data for Germany of the Robert Koch institute

Just getting into Data Science with Python I thought might get some useful insight
on official covid19 data for Germany (where I'm based). The data sets are publicized
by the Robert Koch institute. As one of the very few official sources you might
want to look into these rather than media reports.

The Python Notebook is hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com). It can be run there
but on a local machine as well.

The data can be obtained from https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com where the RKI is updating it regularly:

Based on that data there is a Corona Dashboard for Germany:
